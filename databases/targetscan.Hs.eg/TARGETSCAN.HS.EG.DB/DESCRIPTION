Title: @PKGTITLE@
Description: @PKGTITLE@ assembled 
  using data from the TargetScan website. TargetScan predicts
  biological targets of miRNAs by searching for the presence of
  conserved 8mer and 7mer sites that match the seed region of each
  miRNA. Also identified are sites with mismatches in the seed region
  that are compensated by conserved 3' pairing. In mammals,
  predictions are ranked based on the predicted efficacy of targeting
  as calculated using the context scores of the sites.
